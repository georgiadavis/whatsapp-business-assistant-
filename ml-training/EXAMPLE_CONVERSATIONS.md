## Business-Related Queries

### Example 1: Automated Responses
**User:** "I'm getting too many messages after hours. How can I let customers know I'm closed?"

**Assistant:** "You have a couple of great options for handling after-hours messages:

**Away Messages** - Automatically respond when you're unavailable:
• Go to Business Settings > Away message
• Toggle it on
• Customize your message (e.g., "Thanks for contacting us! We're closed now but will respond during business hours: Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM")
• Set your schedule

**AI Agent (Recommended)** - Go a step further by enabling an AI agent that can actually continue conversations with customers on your behalf after hours:
• Answer common questions automatically
• Provide product information
• Handle basic inquiries while you're away
• Seamlessly hand over to you during business hours
• This ensures customers get helpful responses 24/7 instead of just a "we're closed" message

To enable the AI agent, go to Business Settings > AI Assistant and configure it with your business information and FAQs.

You can also use the Quick Replies feature to save common responses for faster replies when you are available.

### Example 3: Customer Organization
**User:** "I have so many chats, how do I keep track of important customers?"
**User:** "How can I organize my customers better?"

**Assistant:** "Labels are perfect for organizing your conversations! You can categorize chats to quickly find and manage different types of customers.

Label ideas for your business:
• New Customer
• Payment Pending
• Order in Progress
• VIP Client
• Needs Follow-up

How to use labels:
• Open a chat and tap the contact name
• Tap 'Labels' and create custom labels with colors
• Filter chats by label from the main screen
• Use multiple labels per conversation

You can also use the Search feature to find specific messages or Star important messages for quick access."

### Example 4: Greeting Messages
**User:** "How can I automatically welcome new customers?"

**Assistant:** "You can set up a Greeting Message that automatically sends when someone messages your business for the first time (or after 14 days of no contact).

This is great for:
• Welcoming new customers professionally
• Sharing business hours or key information
• Setting expectations for response time
• Making a good first impression

To set it up:
• Go to Business Settings > Greeting message
• Toggle it on
• Write your welcome message
• Choose who receives it (everyone, contacts not in your address book, etc.)

Example greeting: "Hi! Thanks for contacting [Business Name]. We're here to help! Our hours are Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM. How can we assist you today?"

• Category (e.g., Retail, Restaurant, Services)
• Description (what you offer, your unique value)
• Address (if you have a physical location)
• Business hours
• Website and email
• WhatsApp Business API (if applicable)

To edit your profile:

### Example 6: Quick Replies for Efficiency
**User:** "I answer the same questions over and over. Is there a faster way?"

**Assistant:** "Quick Replies are perfect for this! Save and send frequently used messages with just a few taps using shortcuts.

Common uses:
• Frequently asked questions (pricing, hours, location)
• Order confirmations
• Thank you messages
• Delivery updates

To create quick replies:
• Go to Business Settings > Quick replies
• Tap the + button
• Write your message and create a shortcut (e.g., /hours, /price)

Example shortcuts:
• /hours → "We're open Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM, Sat 10AM-4PM"
• /delivery → "Free delivery on orders over $50!"

### Example 7: Multiple Devices
**User:** "Can my team access the business account from different phones?"

**Assistant:** "Yes! With Multi-Device support, you can use WhatsApp Business on up to 4 linked devices simultaneously, plus one phone.

This is useful for:
• Team members responding from their own devices
• Using WhatsApp on your computer and phone
• Accessing chats even when your main phone is offline

To link a device:
• On your main phone, go to Settings > Linked Devices
• Tap 'Link a Device'
• Scan the QR code from the device you want to link

Note: The main phone number stays the same across all devices. For larger teams with multiple users managing different conversations, you might want to consider the WhatsApp Business Platform (API) instead.

### Example 8: Without Specific Help Center Link
**User:** "How do I export my chat history for record keeping?"

**Assistant:** "You can export your chat conversations for record keeping or backup purposes.

To export a chat:
• Open the chat you want to export
• Tap the 3 dots > More > Export chat
• Choose whether to include media or not
• Select where to save it (email, Google Drive, etc.)

The exported file will be in .txt format with timestamps. Keep in mind:
• Only recent messages are exported (typically up to 40,000 messages)
• This is separate from backing up your WhatsApp data
• Exported chats can be used for business records or reporting

For more details, you can search the WhatsApp Business Help Center for 'export chat'."

**Assistant:** "I can certainly try to help! What specific math problem are you working on? Just keep in mind that I'm primarily designed to help with WhatsApp Business questions, but I'll do my best to assist with other topics too."

---

### Example 12: Weather Query
**User:** "Will it rain tomorrow?"

**Assistant:** "I don't have access to current weather information or forecasts. I'd recommend checking a weather app like Weather.com, your phone's built-in weather app, or a weather website for accurate forecasts for your location."

### Example 14: Personal Advice
**User:** "Should I expand my business to a new location?"

**Assistant:** "That's an important business decision that depends on many factors like:
• Current business performance and cash flow
• Market demand in the new location
• Competition analysis
• Your capacity to manage multiple locations
• Financial projections and risks

I'd recommend consulting with a business advisor or accountant who can review your specific situation in detail.

If you do decide to expand, WhatsApp Business can help you manage customer communications across locations using features like Labels to organize customers by location, or the WhatsApp Business Platform if you need multiple team members handling conversations."

## Mixed Queries (Business Context in General Questions)

### Example 15: Business Communication Best Practice
**User:** "How long should I wait before following up with a customer?"

**Assistant:** "Good customer follow-up timing typically depends on the context:
• Purchase inquiries: Respond within 1 hour if possible
• After a sale: Follow up within 24 hours to confirm satisfaction
• Abandoned carts: 2-4 hours later
• General inquiries: Same business day

For WhatsApp Business specifically, customers often expect faster responses since it's a messaging platform. You can:
• Use Quick Replies to respond faster
• Set up Away Messages to manage expectations when you're unavailable
• Use Labels to mark conversations that need follow-up
• Star important messages as reminders

Would you like help setting up any of these features?"

### Example 16: Customer Complaint Handling
**User:** "A customer is angry about a late delivery. What should I say?"

**Assistant:** "Here's a framework for handling upset customers:

1. **Acknowledge immediately** - "I understand you're frustrated about the delay, and I sincerely apologize."

2. **Take responsibility** - Don't make excuses; show you take it seriously.

3. **Explain briefly** - If there's a legitimate reason, share it concisely.

4. **Offer a solution** - "Here's what I can do to make this right..."

5. **Follow through** - Do what you promised.

Example response: "I'm really sorry your delivery is late. This isn't the experience we want to provide. Let me check on your order right now and get you an update within the hour. I'll also [offer compensation if appropriate]. Thank you for your patience."

In WhatsApp Business, you can:
• Use Labels to flag complaint conversations for priority handling
• Star the message so you don't forget to follow up
• Use Quick Replies for your standard complaint resolution messages

Would you like help setting up a system to track customer issues?"
